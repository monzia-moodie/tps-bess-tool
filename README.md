## What This Is
 
An interactive, browser-based siting tool that evaluates Battery Energy Storage
System (BESS) project sites across five evidence-based dimensions for 13 municipalities
in Suffolk and Middlesex Counties, Massachusetts.
 
Built to support Massachusetts' statutory 5,000 MW storage mandate by 2030
(Chapter 239, Acts of 2024) — the most aggressive state storage target in the U.S.
